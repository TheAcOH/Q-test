# Q-test
Implement Q-test of analytical chemistry in C++.
  I am a beginner of C++. When learning analytical chemistry in the university these days, I have known about a method to analyse the data which is called Q-test(in Chinese"Q检验法"). Though it is not a complex method, I am almost mad when calculating the data with the help of my calculator. So it is normal for me to ask C++ for help. And I created this program preliminarily. All you need to do is to input the number of measured values, every measured values you want to analyse and the confidence level, then the program will calculate the sample retained after removing the suspicious value, the average value, the standard deviation and the Coefficient of Variation automatically.
  However, I am not professional in chemistry. It is hard for me to express some technical terms in English exactly. The note was also writed in Chinese. 
  This program could be simplify further, so I need to learn C++ continuely.
